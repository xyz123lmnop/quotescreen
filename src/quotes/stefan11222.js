    `Organize your learning process so it's fun. If you can't spend all day working on the game, then there is no fan, try a different approach. Moreover, it is not necessary to wait for conscious constructive ideas, just try new things. Here's an example of how I did it with English. I decided to change the teacher, simply because "it is not that". I was given a contact girls, after a couple of classes, I realized that I really like her, not only as a girl, but simply as a very charismatic person with an interesting and bright background. All of a sudden, classes went from being "work" to being a welcome experience + there was a motivation to improve their communication skills in a new language. Guys, this magic works. A lot of dopamine = better learning ability, moreover, such experience no longer eats up internal resources, but on the contrary energizes.`,
    `How not to give up on work, in any way, if you work on a fuel called willpower or discipline, then the purpose of your brain for its good is the opposite of what you rationally realize. You need a lot of resources of "inhibitory" neurotransmitters, serotonin, as I understand it, is the main one. Roughly speaking, your brain tells you well, fuck it, play the console, at this moment you need this very resource of serotonin to slow down this impulse and do what the brain does not want. So when we're not getting enough sleep / depressed / stressed, we become wildly addictive. The advice is, until you find a way to get high from work, do everything so that you have more of this valuable resource. Serotonin is most influenced by sleep, physical activity, nutrition, socialization, meditation, stress minimization, sexual and romantic relationships. If there is always order with serotonin, then you can go out on willpower. Another live hack, activities that require a lot of volitional efforts are best done in the morning, at this time we have the most resources.`,
    `At some point, I got insight. What is called a breakthrough to a new level. I began to understand well the mechanics of the game. I'm not talking about the technical part, but rather a conceptual approach. I decided on an interesting experiment, which I did unconsciously many times when I was an nl200 regular. I decided to bet on my subconscious and started playing instinctively. From that moment on, I can no longer stop, I am exploiting my talent to the fullest. I believe that my subconscious mind memorizes and interprets the play of each opponent in different situations in a rather relevant way. This is what I call talent in general. Whoever has the most developed instincts for an activity like playing poker is the strongest player. of course there are some caveats. in addition to instincts, other qualities are also important, directly or indirectly affecting the game, but now we are not talking about that.`
