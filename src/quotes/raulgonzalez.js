  `It is a game of its own to always play as well as possible, no matter how you do it (taking a break / developing more resistance to tilt, etc.), the better you do it, the more money you will win in the long term. sounds very simple, but if you really understand it, then it's incredibly comforting when things go bad. you just have to endure the bad runs, it's just as important to play properly as when things are going well. It's only more difficult in bad runs and that's why you can develop more edge on opponents`,
  "Variance is always crazier than the brain wants to see. The tricky thing is that it is also very important to be self-critical and that clashes with the realization",
  `it is extremely important that whenever you think the opponent has done something bad, think about why that is actually bad or how it is exploited and whether you are already doing it. so often hear from people something like "totally bad bluff from the opponent" because they never bluff even in the spot. makes little sense not to bluff in spots where you think that your opponent should fold a lot, "because nobody is bluffing anyway"
is simply super important to always be consistent in your logic`,
"I would say that you have to be extremely self-critical (because otherwise you won't notice how often you say or think something nonsensical. That happens to everyone, no matter how good you are) and, on the other hand, it's just training that you keep thinking about things , WHY something is bad and then find out if it really makes sense. is a very bad idea to find a game simply bad because it does not correspond to the meta or a supposedly good player finds it bad",
